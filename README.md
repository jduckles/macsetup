macsetup
=========

Quick script and list of apps to install by default on new Mac OS X machines I use.


### Usage
* Fork the repo
* Edit `brew` for source apps from homebrew you want installed
* Edit `apps` for binary apps from homebrew cask you want installed
* Update username at top of `homebrew.sh`
* `bash homebrew.sh`
* Make some coffee, relax

Note: Setup may not be entirely automated as xcode may have to download and some tools may need a root password to be installed
